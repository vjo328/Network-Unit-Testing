        Maps a destination to the result of a nornir task which both belong to a host.

        Note 1: The nornir Result object does not contain a destination property,
        which often means that if the specific task fails (e.g. a ping fails),
        the destination information is missing in the result, and we do not know
        which destination actually failed. It is therefore necessary to patch
        the destination onto the Result object to later know which host-destination pair
        actually failed. As a consequence, typing must ignore the patched attribute.

        Note 2: Why the first result is not used and task_results[1:] instead:
        Tasks per host (such as pinging a series of destinations) are
        nornir (sub)tasks that are executed from within another task.
        For the main task to finish properly, we must return a single Result, such as
        `Result(host=task.host, result="All pings executed")`, that confirms the
        fulfillment of the subtasks. All subsequent Result objects are then the
        completed subtasks. We do not need the first Result that simply confirms
        the fulfilled subtasks, therefore we skip it explicitly
