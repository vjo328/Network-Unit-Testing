# Release Notes for Nuts 3.0.1

The latest 3.0.1 release for Nuts revamps its core and self-tests. Changes:

* Added short [development documentation](https://nuts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/writetests.html) to help you write your own tests.
* Self-tests refactored, added integration tests for test bundles.
* Migrated from `testdir` to `pytester` in self-tests.
* Improved error-handling. Previously, all errors thrown by nuts had been subsumed in a `NutsResult`, which made debugging difficult. Now errors that are not related to the information gathering process are clearly visible and allow for better error reporting and debugging.
* `single_result` fixture refactored. A new `AbstractResultExtractor` class now takes care of transforming the gathered, raw data into a structure used by the test classes. The new structure also simplifies using the custom `nuts` pytest marker.
* Improvements in project management.
* Set-up release pipeline

Planned for release 3.0.2:

* Add more integration tests for "bad" results
* Add API documentation
